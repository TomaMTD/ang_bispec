# üåÄ `ang_bispec`: Python code for galaxy number count angular bispectrum

Based on T. Montandon, et‚ÄØal., ‚ÄúFull angular bispectrum of galaxy number counts: Newtonian and GR terms without Limber,‚Äù arXiv:2501.05422 (2025).

**Description**  
`ang_bispec` is a high-performance Python implementation for computing the angular bispectrum of galaxy number counts. It significantly extends the existing **Byspectrum** code by incorporating **finite redshift bins**, **redshift-space distortions (RSD)**, and leading **general relativistic (GR) projection** and **radiation effects**, all without relying on the Limber approximation.

## Features

- **Complete theoretical model**  
  Based on first- and second-order number count expressions from the literature, covering:
  - Newtonian terms (density, RSD, quadratic terms)
  - Non‚Äëintegrated projection effects  
  - Radiative and dynamical GR effects  

- **Efficient hypergeometric evaluation**  
  Translated the Mathematica expressions from Assassi et al. (2017) into numba‚Äëaccelerated Python for fast computation of the ‚ÇÇF‚ÇÅ hypergeometric function.

- **Pipeline overview**  
  1. **Linear cosmology module**  
     - Solves growth functions **D(z), f(z), v(z), w(z)**  
     - Interfaces with **CLASS** to extract potential transfer functions and power spectra  
  2. **FFTLog module**  
     - Computes Hankel transforms of the potential power spectrum and transfer function  
  3. **Generalized power spectra \(C_‚Ñì(œá)\)**  
     - Precomputes 7 spectra across ‚Ñì and œá values‚Äîthis is the main bottleneck  
  4. **Precomputation of radial integrals**  
     - Integrals over \(r_1\) for all \(f_{n,m}\) coefficients  
  5. **Main bispectrum loop**  
     - Computes contributions for all (‚Ñì‚ÇÅ, ‚Ñì‚ÇÇ, ‚Ñì‚ÇÉ) triplets, including:
       - Density, RSD, projection, quadratic, and cross terms
